#Data Types

#Integer:
#whole numbers (numbers without decimals places)
#Just the numbers without quotes around

print(123+345)

#Large integers
#If you have very large integers you can put "_" between some of them.
#This doesn't change the number, but can make a programmer life easier
print(123_456)

print(type(1))
